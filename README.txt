+==========================+

Masterbot is a piece of code designed to run on the Spooks webchat
and provide access to several things, like quoting subreddits, providing
YouTube video titles, "check 'em", and other stuff.
Most of its code was written by Bruno02468 (me), with some help from Mr. Guy
and Randomguy, but I'm still the main programmer.
