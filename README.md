Masterbot
=========

Masterbot is a piece of code designed to run on the Spooks webchat

and provide access to several things, like quoting subreddits, providing

YouTube video titles, "check 'em", and other stuff.

Most of its code was written by Bruno02468 (me), with some help from Mr. Guy

and Randomguy, but I'm still the main programmer.




You can:

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Contribute code

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Suggest changes

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Use code from this bot

You can NOT:

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Make any calls whatsoever to my server (bruno02468.com) without authorization

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Run the bot without authorization, there's a copy running most of the time

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Violate the license in any way




All the code here is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.




&nbsp; Thanks
